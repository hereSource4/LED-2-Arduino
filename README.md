# LED-2-Arduino
Connecting individually addressable LED strip lights (WS2812B) to Arduino Uno with Processing

LIBRARIES: 
I used several free libraries to connect the LEDs, Arduino, and Processing together, this is mentioned in each code file. 

For Arduino: 
- FastLED, which allows makes coding palettes & effects much eaier with addressesable LEDs  https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

For Processing:
- ControlIP5, which creates controllers easier in a seperate window & render graphics 
https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5
- Processing.Serial, which reads & write data from devices & other programs (like Arduino in our case)

Arduino Equipment used: 
- Arduino Uno & Arduino IDE
- 2x 16'WS2812B LED Strip lights 
- 1x Breadboard 
- 6x jumpercables
- 1x 220 Ohm Resistor
- 1x 100 microFarad Capacitor
- 2x 5v DC Power Adaptors
