These are images that are from the process of learning Arduino hardware & IDE. 

Due to the nature of our project being in a physical space we split off elements to be done at home to be later assembled together when we had all our needed materials. 
I borrowed this Arduino uno & other materials to start learning Arduino hardware & software to make the programmable/controllable LED strip.
